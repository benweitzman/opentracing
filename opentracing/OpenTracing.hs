Module: OpenTracing

The [OpenTracing spec](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md) defines a platform agnostic approach for distributed tracing. Distributed
tracing gives us insights into how complex programs spread across multiple processes are
performing together.

This package provides a core implementation of the OpenTracing spec. It includes
functionality to

  * Create `Span`s describing application code executions, including `Tag`s and
    `LogRecord`s

  * Serialize and deserialize `SpanContext`s across process boundaries

  * Batch and log `FinishedSpan`s

It does not provide any functionality for consuming `Span`s. There are platform specific
backends (CloudTrace, Zipkin, Jaeger, etc) that are provided in other packages.

    ( -- * Distributed tracing
      -- | These are mtl style constraints and runners for working with tracers in
      -- a distributed environment. When traces cross process boundaries (for example
      -- in an RPC call, information about the `SpanContext` needs to be transmitted
      -- from one process to another, so that all `Span`s in the same trace can be
      -- reported in the same trace forest.
      --
      -- | To satisfy these constraints, you have to have access to a `Propagation` in
      -- the application environment, which manages serialization and deserialization of
      -- `SpanContext`s.

      -- | If you aren't tracing a distributed system, these simpler constraints
      -- will work. The only thing required is a `Tracer.Tracer` in the application
      -- context. If the program execution crosses process boundaries, no serialization
      -- will be performed.
